# python-class
Files from my Python training classes that I've been holding at the [TinkerMill](http://www.tinkermill.org).

The files are broken up into folders to match the lessons and the different material covered in each. You can
see the general syllabus in the syllabus.txt file in the root directory of this repository.

This code is hosted on GitHub for all to share, use, and contribute to. If you see mistakes or want to suggest
additional examples please submit a pull request.
